# recipe_app
 
This is a small project I created to dust off the cobwebs of not using React for a few years. Simple project using with the key features being:
- Gathering data from API, using .env to store Access Keys, and displaying said data for multiple paths
- Using react-router-dom for routing while using params to affect page routed to
- Using 'Splide' to allow for a seamless interaction with recipe cards and nice UI
- Having a fully functional search bar which uses API query to match recipe to input
